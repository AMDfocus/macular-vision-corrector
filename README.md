🛠️ Features
Interactive Distortion Mapping
Users click and drag control points on a grid to indicate perceived distortions in their vision.

Live Text Warping
Text is dynamically warped in real time to compensate for the distortion map, making it easier to read.

Adjustable Warp Intensity
Control the strength of correction to suit personal comfort and visibility needs.

Session Management
Save and load custom distortion profiles — perfect for ongoing use or vision testing sessions.

Visual Distortion Metrics
Get useful feedback via average and maximum distortion values to understand visual irregularities.

🎯 How It Works
